            <p>
                At my time at Coding Temple, I have several goals that I intend to accomplish.
                Rather, I've got a list of goals I want to acheive:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li class="r">Take Notes.</li>
                <li class="r">Stay up to date with all ongoing activities.</li>
                <li class="r">Remain an active member in class and interact with peers and instructors alike.</li>
                <li class="r">If possible, be ahead and oversee what the following day's topic will be.</li>
                <li class="r">Be proficient in every programming language taught.</li>
                <li class="r">Go beyond the requirements of each assignment.</li>
                <li class="r">Stay active in Codewars.</li>
                <li class="r">Gather an understanding of what will be expected of me beyond class in the working field.</li>
                <li class="r">Begin programming some of my own personal projects.</li>
                <li class="r">Begin searching for a job as soon as I am able within Coding Temple.</li>
                <li class="r">Stay in constant practice of coding to retain as much as I learn.</li>
                <li class="r">Beyond Coding Temple and employment, seek out continuing my education to further my knowledge,
                    my understanding, and my capabilities as a software engineer.
                </li>
                <li class="r">Continue to update this website and add additional features; improve its quality.
                    There's so much to learn. There's alot more I want to do with this site,
                    though not as much time to implement.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p> I believe Coding Temple is what will show me my potential and test me to show me what I am truly able
                to accomplish. Coding Temple is an opportunity that I have every intention of taking full advantage of
                to be the best I know I can be.
