        <!-- <article> paragraph: About Me, what I do. link to my_goals -->
            <p> Hello, my name is Benjamin Copen and welcome to my portfolio! Here, I intend to share
                a little about myself and show you some of what I like and some of what my goals are
                while I am on my Coding Temple journey. I am 22 years old, I live in Ohio, and as of
                last week (6/5/2023), my main focus in life is becoming a Software Engineer at Coding
                Temple. If you'd rather read about my goals and what I intend to accomplish in these next
                few weeks, I suggest you go check it all out <a href="my_goals.html"> here!</a> If you'd rather
                learn more about me instead, please, keep reading! 
                </a>
            </p>
        </article>

        <!-- <section> paragraph 2: 
        My Hobbies & my accomplishments,
        Form (MUST HAVE ONE: Movie Suggestions)
        -->
            <p> I enjoy a multitude of hobbies such as: playing guitar, mandolin, bass; 
                watching movies, anime, and TV shows; playing video games as well as board games; 
                hammock camping; playing disc golf; as well as going for a nice summer drive in my Acura RSX. 
                I enjoy cooking and making food, and I even have my own dishes I have concocted over the years
                (my special grilled cheese and 'spam'wich are two I'm especially proud of). On occasion when 
                I get the chance, I will do some doodling as well as some minor photography. I love the Autumn 
                weather and the feelings associated with it (hence the thematic coloring).
            </p>
            <p> As mentioned before, I enjoy many a movie; so I wanted to use my form to gather movie suggestions, 
                as despite my watch-list being so long, I could never have enough movie suggestions. So, if you would please, 
                enter a movie that you would
                suggest, one of your favorite movies, your all-time favorite, or even just a movie perhaps you've seen
                recently. For my suggestion to you, I recommend my go-to 'V For Vendetta' (2005).
            </p>
            <form>
                <label for="movie"></label>
                <input type="text" id="movie" name="movie_suggest"
                placeholder="Suggest your movie here!">
                <input type="submit" value="Submit">
            </form>
            <p>Thanks for the suggestion! (hopefully some day I'll get a chance to check it out)</p>
            <br>
            <p> I hope you enjoy the rest of my unfinished portfolio!</p>
