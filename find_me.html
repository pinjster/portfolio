            <p>I do not particularly have a large social presence here on
                the internet, but I do have some websites you can find me on.
            </p>
            <p>I'm here on <a href="https://github.com/pinjster" target="_blank">Github!</a></p>
            <p>I'm here on <a href="https://www.codewars.com/users/pinjster" target="_blank">Codewars!</a></p>
            <p>I listen to alot of music, and while many of my playlists are convaluded, I do have one 
                that I am quite proud of. If you'd like to listen to it, it's right here! It was dubbed 
                'This Slaps' because truly every song in here slaps and has enough funk and groove to 
                get you in a productive, happy, and active mood. (Fun Fact: I listnened to this playlist while making this portfolio)
